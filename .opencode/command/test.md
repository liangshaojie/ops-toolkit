description: Run tests and analyze results
agent: build

Run the test suite and analyze the results.

Execute: !`bun test`

Based on the test results:

1. Identify any failing tests
2. Analyze why tests are failing
3. Suggest fixes for failing tests
4. Check for test coverage gaps
5. Recommend additional test cases if needed

If tests are failing, help me fix them by:

- Updating test assertions
- Fixing the implementation code
- Adding proper mocking if needed
- Handling edge cases properly

Focus on ensuring all tests pass and the codebase remains robust.
